# EPNT-custom-scenery
This is EPNT custom scenery for FlightGear flight simulator, adding hangars and some stationary
objects to the airfield to liven up the area.

All added objects are standard FGFS objects. They should be included in fgdata, but are included
here as well, for completeness.

### How to install
1. Download the repository as a zip or clone it. 
2. Place files in a directory of your choice.
3. Either:
  * add the directory with scenery to the list of `Custom Scenery Locations` in the `Addons` section 
    of the FGLauncher, or
  * use fgfs `--fg-scenery=path/to/scenery` command line option.
